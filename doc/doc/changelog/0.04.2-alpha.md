# Changelog for release 0.0.4.2-alpha (12/23/2014)

This release focuses mostly on bug fixing and new features.

- A first version of the [generic features library](../basics/gen_feats.html) is
	now available as part of `ddlib`, the utility library included in DeepDive.
- The `spouse_example` example and the [application
	walkthrough](../basics/walkthrough/walkthrough.html) were
	expanded to cover the use of [MindTagger](../basics/labeling.html) and of
	the [generic features library](../basics/gen_feats.html).
- The ` --reg_param <regularizationParameter>` option was added to the
	[DimmWitted sampler](../basics/sampler.html) to specify the desired value
	for the l2 regularization parameter used in learning.
- Some internal details of the implementations of the factor graph grounding
	have been changed to avoid changing the schema of user-defined tables.
- [MindTagger](../basics/labeling.html) has been upgraded to fix a bug.
- A couple of typos in function names and log messages have been fixed.
